Overview

Create a simple user management application using React.

 Acceptance Criteria

##Basic

Displays a list of users using JSX
Can add and remove users
Can update existing user information
User info includes
o   First name

o   Last name

o   Address

Has a basic UI (something more than unformatted text on a screen)

##Advanced

Incorporate React Routing so that new and update forms are their own page and URL
Use Redux to manage store
Use Jest to unit test component
 Details

User data should be maintained in the store and modified through actions. It does not have to persist outside of the application (no external JSON files or endpoints necessary).


We’re looking for an understanding of:

##Basic

How to use React’s state and props
The React and Flux lifecycles
ES6 JavaScript

##Advanced

How to use React Router
Redux lifecycles
Unit testing understanding and implementation
Adding custom scripts to run your tasks
Complete at least the Basic acceptance criteria and only attempt the Advanced acceptance criteria if all requirements can be met or if we are expecting you to do so. The environment you use is up to you. Please make your code accessible through Git and be prepared to share it with the team. Please show all your sources, i.e. tutorials, github, etc.
